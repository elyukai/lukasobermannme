Aboutme:

I have graduated at Flensburg University of Applied Sciences in interdisciplinary courses, bridging design and coding. Since 2021 I have been working with multiple clients on a diverse range of projects, from traditional flyers, full corporate designs, web design and development, to specialized web applications.

I love being at this intersection of my clients’ needs, their users’ needs, and connecting them through a holistic approach to design and implementation. However, I like doing work on solid foundations, so always getting into the next design trend or newest framework is not something for me. I am not going for Apple-like designs or orchestration of ‘AI’.

Outside of my work, I really enjoy pen-and-paper games (think *Dungeons & Dragons*), playing the piano, and tea. And I love learning something new every day.
