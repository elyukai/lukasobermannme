Aboutme:

I’ve done my B. Sc. in Media Informatics and I’m currently studying Applied Computer Science (M. Sc.), both at Flensburg University of Applied Sciences.

I’ve been working with JavaScript and TypeScript for over five years. I am a big fan of React and related libraries as well as functional programming in general. For websites, I enjoy using Kirby as a CMS, since it’s very flexible and can adapt to (almost) all needs. For apps, I prefer native development with Kotlin and Swift to build the best possible experience.

On the design side, I’m very familiar with Adobe’s Creative Cloud, but also the Affinity suite and individual software such as Figma or Sketch.

When I’m not working, I really enjoy pen-and-paper games, playing the piano, and tea. And learning something new everyday.
