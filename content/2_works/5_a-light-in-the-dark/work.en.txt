Description:

*A Light in the Dark* is a dexterity game where you have to roll a ball through a labyrinth of paths to collect points and find the end. I created the game during a game programming module at university as the module's assignment.

I paid a lot of attention to the look and feel of the game and the difficuly of the levels rather than complex game mechanics. My goal was to create a pleasing but challenging game while being easy to use.
