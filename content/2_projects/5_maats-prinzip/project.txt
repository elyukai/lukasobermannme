Description:

*Maats Prinzip* is a card game three friends of mine and I invented during a game design module at university as the module's assignment. We had to come up with completely new ideas how to play a game to make it unique. That did not only cover the game's mechanics, but the background story and graphic design as well.

*Maats Prinzip* takes place in ancient Egypt where you are part of he followers of either Aton or the established gods. As a team, you create bracelets to collect points and you decorate them to unleash strong effects to hinder the enemy team.

I was responsible for most of the graphic design, created the base idea for the background and contributed to the game's mechanics.
