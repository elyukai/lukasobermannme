Title: Lukas Obermann

About:

My (real) name is Lukas Obermann and I'm 25 years old. Currently I am a student of Applied Computer Science (M. Sc.) at Flensburg University of Applied Sciences and I've done my B. Sc. in Media Informatics at the same university.

I've been using JavaScript and TypeScript for a few years now and recently started to use ReasonML and OCaml. I am a big fan of React and related libraries as well as functional programming techniques. When searching for a backend solution for web projects, I enjoy using Kirby CMS, since it’s very flexible and can adapt to (almost) all needs.

On the design side, I use the Adobe CC software on a regular basis, especially InDesign, Photoshop, Illustrator and XD. I use it for basically all projects you can find on this page – as well as the page itself.

When I'm not working, I really enjoy playing pen-and-paper games and playing the piano.
