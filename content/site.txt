About:

My (real) name is Lukas Obermann and I'm 23 years old. Currently I am a student of Media Informatics (B.Sc.) at Flensburg University of Applied Sciences.

I've been using JavaScript and TypeScript for a few years now and recently started to use ReasonML. I am a big fan of React and related libraries as well as functional programming techniques.

On the design side, I use the Adobe CC software on a regular basis, especially InDesign, Photoshop, Illustrator and XD. I use it for basically all projects you can find on this page – as well as the page itself.

When I'm not working, I really enjoy playing pen-and-paper games and playing the piano.
