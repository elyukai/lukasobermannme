Title: Innovate! Festival Web App

Description: <p>The module <em>Organization and Innovation Management</em> at Technische Universit√§t Berlin (TU Berlin) contains a multi-day event, where students can experience innovation in a company at hand. The <em>Innovate! Festival</em> previously used printed scripts and playbooks for students to fill out. The organizers at TU Berlin approached me to develop a web application to replace all paperwork and to make it easier to manage, especially during the event itself.</p><p>In the conception phase I had to develop a schema to be able to translate the scripts into data structures, as well as understanding what tools the organizers need and how they imagine tasks for students to look like.</p><p>I developed the web application using PHP and the Symfony framework, using Twig Components and Live Components for the frontend to keep most of the application in PHP. The UI design was made by hand and reflects TU Berlin brand colors and design elements.</p>
