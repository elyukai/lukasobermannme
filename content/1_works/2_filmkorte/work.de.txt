Title: filmkorte

----

Description:

filmkorte started with the *Media Conception* module at FUAS from Sep 2018 to Feb 2019, which aims at creating Corporate Designs. In 2018, we were asked to create a new branding for the *Flensburger Kurzfilmtage e. V.*, which hosts the (link: https://www.flensburger-kurzfilmtage.de/ text: Flensburger Kurzfilmtage) short film event in Flensburg – but since the association has grown over the past 10 years, they needed a branding that clearly tells they are not hosting only the FKFT anymore but other events as well. And this was the main point that should be reflected with the rebranding.

We started by defining their brand's core values and utilizing a brand filter to create a new logo, claim and name: *filmdocks – Heimathafen für Kurzfilme*. We then projected the brand core onto different media: from business cards and flyers to a fully remade website that suits both their needs and those of future users.

The management then selected a few rebranding submissions – which we were part of – and then in late 2019 decided that we were the group with a design that fits their vision most. One exception: They felt our name and claim were too locally focused and so we needed to come up with a new name and claim that both fits their vision and the current branding, since they liked the latter one a lot.

Finishing their branding and implementing the actual website was the topic we chose for the *Project* module at FUAS starting Mar 2020. We chose (link: https://getkirby.com/ text: Kirby) as the CMS because we felt it had a great Editor Experience and it's simplicity and customizability fitted simple sites with complex layouts – like our new page – very well.

The project was finished in late 2020 and the (link: https://filmkorte.de text: new branding has been launched) on May 1, 2021.
