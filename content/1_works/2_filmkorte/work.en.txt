Description: <p>filmkorte started with the <em>Media Conception</em> module at FUAS from Sep 2018 to Feb 2019, which aims at creating Corporate Designs. In 2018, we were asked to create a new branding for the <em>Flensburger Kurzfilmtage e. V.</em>, which hosts the <a href="https://www.flensburger-kurzfilmtage.de">Flensburger Kurzfilmtage</a> short film event in Flensburg – but since the association has grown over the past 10 years, they needed a branding that clearly tells they are not hosting only the FKFT anymore but other events as well. And this was the main point that should be reflected with the rebranding.</p><p>We started by defining their brand‘s core values and utilizing a brand filter to create a new logo, claim and name: <em>filmdocks – Heimathafen für Kurzfilme</em>. We then projected the brand core onto different media: from business cards and flyers to a fully remade website that suits both their needs and those of future users.</p><p>The management then selected a few rebranding submissions – which we were part of – and then in late 2019 decided that we were the group with a design that fits their vision most. One exception: They felt our name and claim were too locally focused and so we needed to come up with a new name and claim that both fits their vision and the current branding, since they liked the latter one a lot.</p><p>Finishing their branding and implementing the actual website was the topic we chose for the <em>Project</em> module at FUAS starting Mar 2020. We chose <a href="https://getkirby.com">Kirby</a> as the CMS because we felt it had a great Editor Experience and its simplicity and customizability fitted simple sites with complex layouts – like our new page – very well.  The project was finished in late 2020 and the <a href="https://filmkorte.de">new branding has been launched</a> on May 1, 2021.</p>
